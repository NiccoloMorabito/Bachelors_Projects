# Embedded and Multicore Programming - Final project with Arduino

I created a multifunction device with alarm and timer with which you can interact through the remote control receiving feedback on the LCD screen. The home consists of a screen with time, date and temperature detected in real-time by the KY-028 Digital Temperature sensor.

Using the arrows on the remote control it is possible to move through the menu, consisting of the following items:
- Alarm clock
- Timer
- Digital Temperature sensor
- Light sensor
- Humidity and Temperature sensor

The project is composed also by the graphical representation of the data detected by the three aforementioned sensors through the Processing software. Finally, a Python script manages the automatic regulation of the LCD screen backlight.
